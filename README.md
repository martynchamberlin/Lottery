Lottery
=======

Lottery is a Java program that implements polymorphism via an interface and an abstract class. 

The primary purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate our knowledge of inheritance for a 3000-level Object Oriented class at Northeastern State University. As the very next chapter of our textbook deals with polymorphism, and since polymorphism is the ultimate manifestation of inheritance and arguably the entire reason for the entire object oriented paradigm, I have implemented it heavily in this assignment. 

## Implementation

The game play is a pretty accurate execution of the 3 most popular games at [the Oklahoma lottery site](http://www.lottery.ok.gov/online_games.asp). They are as follows:

- Powerball
- MegaMillions
- HotLotto

The interesting thing about these three games is that their execution is very similar to each other, which makes this a good case study for inheritance. 

I have not build out every feature of these lottery games (primarily the ability to have Multidraw) due primarily to time constraints and lack of interest. 

## Opinion

This assignment has firmly fixed in my head that the lottery is a tax on stupid people; it is truly deplorable how low one's chances of making a winning are, and it is even more deplorable how low that winning is statistically likely to be even when it does occur. I think anyone who has an addiction to gambling will, upon building a similar piece of software, be convinced of the utter folly of participating as a consumer in this industry.
